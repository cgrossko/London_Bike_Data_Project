**Project Title: London Daily Bike Rider Analysis
Overview**
This Python project aims to analyze London's daily bike rider data extracted from a CSV file. The data is cleaned and processed using Python code within a Jupyter notebook. The project includes visualizations to illustrate important factors affecting the number of daily bike riders. Finally, the cleaned data is exported to an Excel file.

**Files Included:**
Original CSV File: This file contains the raw daily bike rider data for London.

Cleaned Data Excel File: This Excel file contains the cleaned and processed data after extraction and manipulation.

Jupyter Notebook: This notebook file (.ipynb) contains the Python code used for data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and exporting to Excel.

**Instructions:**
Follow the steps below to run the project:

Download all the files included in the project: the original CSV file, the cleaned data Excel file, and the Jupyter notebook.

Open the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the Python code.

The notebook will first extract the London daily bike rider data from the CSV file.

It will then clean and process the data, including handling missing values, converting data types, and performing necessary transformations.

The notebook will create visualizations to illustrate important factors affecting daily bike ridership, such as weather conditions, seasonality, or temperature.

Finally, the cleaned data will be exported to an Excel file.

Review the generated visualizations and the exported Excel file for insights into London's daily bike rider trends.

**Dependencies.**
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
